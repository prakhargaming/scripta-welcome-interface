This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Different Pages and Figma
This is the [link](https://www.figma.com/design/4TTKiZBWNj3BVHnpH7McFs/VDart-Figma?node-id=1439-126&t=E4HT0VewWMuu1kLp-0) to the Figma design. All .tsx pages can be found in the `./src/pages` directory. Every `[name].tsx` page in the `./src/pages` directory corresponds to it's respective page in the Figma design. I am still working on stylization fixes and as well as generally optimizing the code.
